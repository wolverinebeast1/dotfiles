#NOTE: An script will be written for doing the steps below 


#Step 1
Download the nerd fonts at "nerdfonts.com/font-downloads"

#Step 2

Go the directory and copy the .zip file to ~/.local/share/fonts
if the fonts directory isnt created , create it by
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts

#Step 3 
Go to ~/.local/share/fonts directory and unzip the .zip file using unzip command utility. If its not installed , install by running
sudo pacman -Sy unzip -> Here I assume you use arch btw:)

#Step 4
Run fc-cache -fv command to refresh the fonts cache and you are good to go

#Step 5 
If you use kitty terminal like I do you can list all the fonts available by running
kitty +list-fonts -psnames
